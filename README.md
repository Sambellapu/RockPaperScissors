Instructions

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game for two or more players.
Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), 
a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).

The rules are straightforward:
-> Rock smashes scissors

-> Paper covers rock

-> Scissors cut paper

Take User Input:-
The task here is to ask the user what they would like to choose as an action and then assign that choice to a variable.

Make the Computer Choose:-
Random selections are a great way to have the computer choose a pseudorandom value. random.choice() can be used to 
have the computer randomly select between the actions

Determine a Winner:-
Now that both players have made their choice, we just need a way to decide who wins. Using an if … elif … else block, 
can compare players’ choices and determine the winner.
